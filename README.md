# Deeper Meaning
### Open API Search

https://deeper-meaning.herokuapp.com

## Task

Using Ruby on Rails and a public API of your choice, create a page where a public user can do a keyword search and view results, with a sidebar showing previous searches and a link to kick them off. This doesn’t need user auth.  The API source can be anything you find interesting (music, movies, hiking trails, books, etc).

We’re interested in how you approach the ruby and rails pieces. This does not need fancy Javascript or styling. 

Please do an initial commit after `rails new`, and commit logical chunks of work along the way.  Share the repo on github, and publish to a free Heroku app so our team can check it out without everyone installing it.
